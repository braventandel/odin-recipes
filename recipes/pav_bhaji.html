    <h2>About Pav Bhaji</h2>
    <p>Pav Bhaji is a vibrant and spicy street food classic originating from the bustling streets of Mumbai. The dish
        features "Bhaji," a thick and flavorful mash of mixed vegetables like potatoes, cauliflower, and peas, cooked
        with a special blend of spices on a large flat griddle. It is traditionally served piping hot, topped with a
        dollop of butter, fresh coriander, and lemon juice, alongside "Pav," soft buttery bread rolls toasted to
        perfection.</p>
