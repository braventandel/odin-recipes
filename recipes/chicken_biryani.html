    <h2>About Chicken Biryani</h2>
    <p>Chicken Biryani is a majestic and aromatic dish that stands as a centerpiece of festive Indian dining. It is a
        layered delicacy where marinated chicken and basmati rice are cooked separately before being assembled and
        slow-cooked together in a sealed pot, a technique known as "dum." This process allows the steam to infuse the
        rice with the complex flavors of saffron, caramelized onions, and whole spices, resulting in a fragrant and
        hearty one-pot meal.</p>

    <h2>INGREDIENTS:</h2>

    <h3>Chicken Marinade</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500g chicken (bone-in pieces)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup yogurt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp ginger-garlic paste</li>
        <li>1 tsp red chili powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp garam masala</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Mint and coriander leaves (chopped)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Rice</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups Basmati rice (soaked for 30 mins)</li>
        <li>Whole spices: 2 bay leaves, 4 cloves, 4 green cardamoms, 1-inch cinnamon stick.</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Layering/Assembly</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large onions (sliced thinly and fried until brown - "Birista")</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk with a pinch of saffron threads soaked in it</li>
        <li>Ghee (clarified butter)</li>
        <li>Fresh mint and coriander leaves</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>STEPS:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Marinate Chicken: Mix chicken with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, spices, salt, and herbs. Let it marinate for
            at least 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Cook Chicken: Heat oil/ghee in a heavy-bottomed pot. Add the marinated chicken and cook over medium heat
            until the chicken is 80% cooked and the oil separates.</li>
        <li>Cook Rice: Boil water with salt and whole spices. Add soaked rice and cook until it is 70% done (the grain
            should still have a slight bite). Drain the water.</li>
        <li>Layering (Dum): In a heavy pot, spread the cooked chicken gravy at the bottom. Layer the partially cooked
            rice over the chicken.</li>
        <li>Garnish: Top the rice with fried onions (Birista), chopped mint, and coriander. Pour the saffron milk and a
            tablespoon of melted ghee over the top.</li>
        <li>Steam (Dum Cooking): Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid (you can seal the edges with dough or aluminum
            foil). Cook on very low heat for 15-20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve: Fluff the rice gently to mix the layers and serve hot with Raita.</li>

    </ol>
